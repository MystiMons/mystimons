# REVEAL POLICY — SET-006

## Target reveal band
**S2–S3 boundary (still no explicit Origin truth; reserve S3 for SET-007)** (see `03_TCG/sets/REVEAL_LEVELS.md`)

## Print vs App/AR
- **Print:** Avoid explicit confirmations that exceed the target reveal band.
- **App/AR:** May present reveal-aligned overlays, but must respect spoiler gates:
  - Book 4 transition spoilers are never rendered early.
  - Full Origin truths are reserved for SET-007 / Book 7.

## Guardrails
- If a card concept requires S3 knowledge to make sense, it is **not legal** before SET-007.
- Prefer ambiguity: myth/legend framing for S1–S2.
