- Deterministic window control (Charge / Clash / Afterglow).
- Zone locking during Clash (integrity).

## Set-specific focus
- Hidden Intent (if adopted) support
- Match logs for competitive analysis

## Non-goals

- Avoid introducing high-admin subsystems that require constant manual confirmations.

## Telemetry
- Log: zone changes, lock violations, and resolution timing to support playtest analysis.
