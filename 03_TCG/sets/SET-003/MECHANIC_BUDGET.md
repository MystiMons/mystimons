# MECHANIC BUDGET — SET-003

## Budget
Max 2 new Keywords; 1 digital layer that increases tactical depth (no additional table admin).

## Constraints
- No mechanic should require tracking more than **3 concurrent digital counters** per player by default.
- Any RNG must be either:
  - player-chosen risk (opt-in), or
  - replaced by deterministic / skill-check logic in competitive modes.

## Notes
Allow stronger 'myth-to-truth' tension, still avoid S3.
