# MECHANIC BUDGET — SET-002

## Budget
Max 2 new Keywords; 1 optional digital-only subsystem (no new hardware requirements).

## Constraints
- No mechanic should require tracking more than **3 concurrent digital counters** per player by default.
- Any RNG must be either:
  - player-chosen risk (opt-in), or
  - replaced by deterministic / skill-check logic in competitive modes.

## Notes
Maintain mystery stance; no explicit Origin truths.
