# MECHANIC BUDGET — SET-007

## Budget
Max 1–2 new Keywords; prioritize the Origin Frame overlay and narrative unlocks.

## Constraints
- No mechanic should require tracking more than **3 concurrent digital counters** per player by default.
- Any RNG must be either:
  - player-chosen risk (opt-in), or
  - replaced by deterministic / skill-check logic in competitive modes.

## Notes
This set is the only place where full Origin truths are allowed.
