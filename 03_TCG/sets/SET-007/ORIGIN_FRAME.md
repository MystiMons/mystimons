# ORIGIN FRAME — SET-007 (Aetherion)

## Purpose
Provide a distinct, premium-feeling set frame that delivers **S3** truth while remaining a playable TCG product.

## Frame rules (design intent)
- **Print text stays clean.** Origin truth is delivered primarily via App/AR overlays and Chronicle unlocks.
- **Chronicle Layer:** Each card may have one or more unlockable "Chronicle entries" (lore fragments).
- **Sequenced reveals:** Chronicle entries unlock in a controlled sequence (e.g., by match achievements, campaign progression, or release gating).

## Spoiler gates
- Chronicle entries tagged `[REVEAL:S3]` are not accessible prior to Book 7 release.
- Tournament mode may optionally disable Chronicle displays during matches (focus mode) while preserving legality.

## AR patterns
- Time-stamped overlays (e.g., "Then/Now" dual rendering).
- Region/Artifact anchors that visually connect to earlier sets without rewriting them.

## Anti-exploit constraints
- Chronicle unlocks must not yield power advantages in Ranked/Tournament.
- Any progression-linked access is cosmetic or narrative, not statistical.
