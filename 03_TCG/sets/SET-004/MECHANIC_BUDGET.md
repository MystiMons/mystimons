# MECHANIC BUDGET — SET-004

## Budget
Max 3 new Keywords (one may be digital-first); introduce 'Shift' framing tools.

## Constraints
- No mechanic should require tracking more than **3 concurrent digital counters** per player by default.
- Any RNG must be either:
  - player-chosen risk (opt-in), or
  - replaced by deterministic / skill-check logic in competitive modes.

## Notes
Print text must avoid explicit spoilers; App may reveal only after configured release gate.
