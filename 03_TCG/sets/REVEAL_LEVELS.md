# REVEAL LEVELS (S0–S3)
**Purpose:** Operational definition of spoiler boundaries across Books (1–7), TCG Sets, and App/AR.

## S0 — Public Surface
- Marketing-safe. No confirmations of deep mysteries.
- Allowed: factions, regions, starter MystiMons, basic system concepts.

## S1 — Early-Series Hints
- Reinforces the mystery without resolving it.
- Allowed: myths, partial artifacts, ambiguous references.

## S2 — Late-Series Truths (Pre-Origin)
- Confirms major mechanics/consequences in the main timeline.
- Not allowed: definitive Origin explanation of Aetherion (that is S3).

## S3 — Origin / Full Disclosure
- Reserved for **Book 7 / SET-007**.
- Allowed: explicit Origin truths, definitive causality.

## Labeling standard
- Any TCG/App content that touches S1+ must carry a tag in its design notes:
  - `[REVEAL:S1]`, `[REVEAL:S2]`, `[REVEAL:S3]`
- Print-facing text should avoid explicit S2/S3 terms unless the set policy allows it.
